# Idea Playground Project

## Project Goal
This is an **idea playground** - a UI that allows the user to explore, develop, and organize their ideas in a structured way. The core concept is to provide a ticket-based interface where ideas can be viewed, edited, filtered, and organized.

## Development Philosophy
- **Work Incrementaly**: Work in small chuncks, commiting each time there is a working tested state
- **Test-driven**: Start with failing e2e tests before implementing features
- **Component thinking**: Always consider loaders, warnings, error states
- **Data abstraction**: Keep data layer separate in a simple backend
- **User experience**: Focus on smooth interactions and intuitive UI


## Key Features
- **Multiple view modes**: Kanban board (organized by readiness) and detailed list view with reordering
- **Rich editing**: Modal editor with markdown support and metadata editing, plus full-screen mode
- **Dimensions system**: Structured tagging system with field, readiness, complexity, and connections
- **Filtering**: AND-based filtering by dimensions with clean tag-style interface
- **Drag & drop**: Visual arrangement and reordering of ideas
- **Data abstraction**: JSON-based storage with layer ready for backend migration

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Markdown editing**: @uiw/react-md-editor
- **Drag & drop**: @dnd-kit
- **Testing**: Playwright for e2e tests
- **Data**: JSON files (ideas.json, dimensions.json)


## File Structure
- `/src/components/` - React components
- `/src/services/` - Data access layer (abstracts JSON operations)
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript interfaces
- `/data/` - JSON data files
- `/tests/` - Playwright e2e tests
