## Important Notes
- Run the tests in a way that will finish in a command line so Cursor chat doesn't get stuck - npx playwright test --reporter=list
- Use PlayWright MCP when relevant to manually test every change you make
- Stick to the PRODUCT_SPEC.md and keep it up to date with changes
- Where possible, use existing popular libraries
- If you are unsure about any detail, stop and ask me
