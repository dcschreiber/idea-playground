## Important Notes
- Run the tests with --reporter=list and headless when possible
- Use PlayWright MCP when relevant to manually test every change you make
- Stick to the PRODUCT_SPEC.md and keep it up to date with changes
- Where possible, use existing popular libraries
- If you are unsure about any detail, stop and ask me
- Commit every time you reach a stable working version with all tests passing
